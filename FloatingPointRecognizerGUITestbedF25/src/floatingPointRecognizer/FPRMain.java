/*******
 * <p> Title: FloatingPointRecognizerMain Class - The GUI mainline version of this application</p>
 *
 * <p> Description: This is the Main Class that launches the FloatingPointRecognizer GUI version of
 * this demonstration application.  This is a JavaFX application designed to help student see how
 * integrate components into a larger application.
 * 
 * On startup, the application establishes the GUI's Model View Controller (MVC) View page, shows 
 * it to the user, and stops.  The application continues to run in the background with the JavaFX 
 * window displayed, waiting for the user to do something with the GUI elements in the window.
 * 
 * When the user interacts with the GUI's View, the GUI element the user used (e.g., a text input
 * field or a button) will cause either a model action (e.g. entering text into a text field) or a
 * controller action (e.g., pushing on a button) to perform an action.
 * 
 * In this GUI application, there is a text field into which the user is expected to enter the 
 * characters of what is supposed to be a floating point number and a button to press to signal
 * that the user is finished entering input.
 * 
 * This application does not use the command line arguments, but Java and JavaFX in Eclipse
 * requires they be made available, even if they are not needed.</p>
