	 * 
	 * This "constructor" was written this way due to a design requirement that it would be called
	 * before any other constructor in the MVC Display Package.  Unlike the others, this has a
	 * parameter of the Stage onto which these GUI elements are to be placed.  The first thing
	 * this method does is invoke the actual private constructor using the passed-in parameter. It
	 * then invokes the other two singleton "constructors" (i.e.,  Model and the Controller) and
	 * then defines three private static variables for it's own use.
	 * 
	 * This "constructor" does not return a value as the caller will not be using a reference
	 * to this View.  The very next thing the caller does is show the Stage and then it stops.</p>

	 * @param theRoot Specifies the Stage on which the GUI should be built.
